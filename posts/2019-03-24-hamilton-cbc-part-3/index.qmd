This is a series of five posts for this data:

-   [Part 1](../2019-01-07-hamilton-cbc-part-1/): data downloading and cleaning

-   [Part 2a](../2019-02-23-hamilton-cbc-part-2a/): more cleaning

-   [Part 2b](../2019-02-24-hamilton-cbc-part-2b/): visualizing

-   [Part 3](../2019-03-24-hamilton-cbc-part-3/): a Shiny app

# Introduction

This post is to demonstrate a Shiny app I made so that people could look through the data themselves!

I was able to make this whole app very easily thanks to the wonderful tutorial found [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson1/)!

# Data visualizing using a Shiny app

Here is the link to my Shiny app: <https://sharleenw.shinyapps.io/hamilton_cbc_shiny/>

And here is the code I used to make the app:

```{r shiny, code = readLines(here("posts", "2019-03-24-hamilton-cbc-part-3", "hamilton_cbc_shiny", "app.R")), message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE}


```

And thank you to the Christmas Bird Count! The Christmas Bird Count Data was provided by [National Audubon Society](www.christmasbirdcount.org) and through the generous efforts of [Bird Studies Canada](www.bsc-eoc.org) and countless volunteers across the western hemisphere.

# Session info

```{r reproducibility, echo = FALSE}

devtools::session_info()

```
