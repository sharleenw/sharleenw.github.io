My name is Sharleen (she/her) and I currently live on the lands of the Snuneymuxw and Snaw-naw-as First Nations, who have been caring for the land, water, and air since time immemorial.

I am a Data Scientist who uses R/RStudio, R Markdown/Quarto/LaTeX, git, SQL, and Shiny to create data visualizations, analyses, R packages, and reports.

When not programming, I like to bird, hike, climb, cook, or practice handstands.

## Education

In 2015, I graduated with an M.Sc. in Statistics from McMaster University.

In 2011, I graduated with a B.Eng. in Chemical Engineering and Bioengineering from McMaster University.
